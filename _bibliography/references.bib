abstract ={Computer codes are used in scientific research to study and predict the behaviour of complex systems. Their run times often make uncertainty and sensitivity analyses impractical because of the thousands of runs that are conventionally required, so efficient techniques have been developed based on a statistical representation of the code. The approach is less straightforward for dynamic codes, which represent time-evolving systems. We develop a novel iterative system to build a statistical model of dynamic computer codes, which is demonstrated on a rainfall-runoff simulator.},

@article{Oakley:2009,
 ISSN = {00401706},
 abstract = {When using a computer model to inform a decision, it is important to investigate any uncertainty in the model and determine how that uncertainty may impact on the decision. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, model users can investigate how various uncertain model inputs contribute to the uncertainty in the model output. However, much of the literature focuses only on output uncertainty as measured by variance; the decision problem itself often is ignored, even though uncertainty as measured by variance may not equate to uncertainty about the optimum decision. Consequently, traditional variance-based measures of input parameter importance may not correctly describe the importance of each input. We review a decisiontheoretic framework for conducting sensitivity analysis that addresses this problem. Because computation of these decision-theoretic measures can be impractical for complex computer models, we provide efficient computational tools using Gaussian processes. We give an illustration in the field of medical decision making, and compare the Gaussian process approach with conventional Monte Carlo sampling.},

abstract = {Summary.â In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework which unifies the various tools of probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be computed from a single set of runs.},

doi = {10.1093/biomet/89.4.769},
abstract ={We consider a problem of inference for the output of a computationally expensive computer model. We suppose that the model is to be used in a context where the values of one or more inputs are uncertain, so that the input configuration is a random variable. We require to make inference about the induced distribution of the output. This distribution is called the uncertainty distribution, and the general problem is known to users of computer models as uncertainty analysis. To be specific, we develop Bayesian inference for the distribution and density functions of the model output. Modelling the output, as a function of its inputs, as a Gaussian process, we derive expressions for the posterior mean and variance of the distribution and density functions, based on data comprising observed outputs at a sample of input configurations. We show that direct computation of these expressions may encounter numerical difficulties. We develop an alternative approach based on simulating approximate realisations from the posterior distribution of the output function. Two examples are given to illustrate our methods.},

abstract={This paper is due to appear as a chapter of the forthcoming Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) by S. Sisson, L. Fan, and M. Beaumont. We describe the challenge of calibrating climate simulators, and discuss the differences in emphasis in climate science compared to many of the more traditional ABC application areas. The primary difficulty is how to do inference with a computationally expensive simulator which we can only afford to run a small number of times, and we describe how Gaussian process emulators are used as surrogate models in this case. We introduce the idea of history matching, which is a non-probabilistic calibration method, which divides the parameter space into (not im)plausible and implausible regions. History matching can be shown to be a special case of ABC, but with a greater emphasis on defining realistic simulator discrepancy bounds, and using these to define tolerances and metrics. We describe a design approach for choosing parameter values at which to run the simulator, and illustrate the approach on a toy climate model, showing that with careful design we can find the plausible region with a very small number of model evaluations. Finally, we describe how calibrated GENIE-1 (an earth system model of intermediate complexity) predictions have been used, and why it is important to accurately characterise parametric uncertainty.}
