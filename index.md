# Welcome
We are a research group in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) at the University of Sheffield. Our interests are in statistical problems associated with the use of complex mathematical or 'computer' models: models derived from an understanding of the underlying physical process, as opposed to purely empirical or statistical models.

Such problems include: investigating model output uncertainty induced by model input uncertainty; calibrating models to physical observations; assessing the discrepancy model predictions and reality; analysis with computationally expensive models. 

Currently, we are spread across two departments: [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths), and [the School of Health and Related Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr)
