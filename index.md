# Welcome
I'm a lecturer in biostatistics in the [CHICAS research group](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk) at Lancaster university. I'm interested in statistical machine learning and how it can be applied in biosciences and epidemiology. I hold a fellowship from the MRC in biostatistics.

I'm also a visiting researcher at Manchester University with [Magnus Rattray](http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/people/profile/?alias=rattraym), where I help work on [BitSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BitSeq.html), a method for quantifying gene and isoform eqpression from RNA-seq data.

I helped create [GPy](http://github.com/sheffieldML/GPy), a python package for developing Gaussian process models. I also created [GPClust](http://github.com/jameshensman/gpclust), a package for clustering time series models using GPs, Dirichlet processes and variational Bayes.

Previously I worked at Sheffield University with [Neil Lawrence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/neuroscience/staff/lawrence), after completing a PhD with [Keith Worden](http://shef.ac.uk/drg/people/keith).
