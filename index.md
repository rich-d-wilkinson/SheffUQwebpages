# Welcome
We are a research group in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) at the University of Sheffield. Our interests are in statistical problems associated with the use of complex mathematical or 'computer' models: models derived from an understanding of the underlying physical process, as opposed to purely empirical or statistical models.

Such problems include: investigating model output uncertainty induced by model input uncertainty; calibrating models to physical observations; assessing the discrepancy model predictions and reality; analysis with computationally expensive models.

We work on both methodology and applications in a range of domains, including archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research; health economics; manufacturing; mathematical modelling of the heart; robust engineering design.

Currently, we are spread across four departments: [the School of Mathematics and Statistics (SoMaS)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths), [the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr), [the Department of Computer Science](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) and [the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/index)

# Email list

We maintain a mailing list: Uncertainty in Computer Models (UCM), which is used for announcing conferences, jobs, papers etc. The list is fully moderated. To join the UCM mailing list, please email [sympa@lists.shef.ac.uk](mailto:sympa@lists.shef.ac.uk) with *subscribe ucm* as the subject.  

# Research visitors

SoMaS hosts short and long term research visits through its Mathematics and Statistics Research Centre. Please contact us if you are interested in visiting our group. Financial support may be available.
