Applications are invited for a fully funded 3-year PhD position to study sound wave propagation outdoors from a variety of sound sources.

The aim of this project is to understand how uncertainties in the outdoor environment affect the accuracy of the predictions obtained with a range of mathematical and statistical models of variable complexity. 

This work will be carried out in collaboration with the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. The main contribution of this work will be the development of new tools and techniques to evaluate the susceptibility of air and land platforms to acoustic detection in all conditions. This will provide a much greater understanding of the risk to the platform and, consequently, supports the risk-based decision-making needed to carry out affordable and effective operations in air and land battlespace. 

The project will involve working in an inter-disciplinary team of mathematicians, physicists and engineers. The project will allow the PhD student to gain training and experience in the tools and techniques used in the other disciplines, extending their skill set and experience base. The student will be based in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mecheng) at Sheffield, but will have the opportunity to travel in the UK and overseas. The student will benefit from direct support from the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths) at Sheffield. 

# Entry Requirements: 

A 2.1 and above degree in Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Computing or a related discipline.
