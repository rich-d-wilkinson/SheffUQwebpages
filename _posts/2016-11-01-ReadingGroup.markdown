Reading group on model calibration and inverse problems (1)
Hicks J11, 3-4pm

This term we will start a reading group on the theme of [model calibration and inverse problems](http://mucm.aston.ac.uk/MUCM/MUCMToolkit/index.php?page=MetaOverviewReality.html). At the first meeting, there will be an introductory-level tutorial on Bayesian calibration and history matching. All are welcome.
