Reading group on model calibration and inverse problems (3)
Hicks J11, 3-4pm

At this meeting, we will discuss the paper 

Knowles, J. (2005). [ParEGO: A hybrid algorithm with on-line landscape approximation for expensive multiobjective optimization problems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1583627/), IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 10 (1), pp. 50-66. 

and consider the connections between optimisation and model calibration.
