**The use of Bayesian calibration in the prediction of damage in structures**
Hicks J11, 3-4pm

This talk will include an overview of the field of structural health monitoring and damage identification, where the use of Bayesian calibrated models fit in and the aims of using this technique. It will conclude with challenges and future aims of using Bayesian calibrated subsystem models to make full system predictions of damage.
