I recently attended the excellent [Past Earth Network](http://www.pastearth.net/index.html) conference at Crewe Hall. This is an EPSRC funded network that aims to improve communication between Palaeo-climate scientists and statisticians.
At the meeting, delegates were asked to join one of four different working groups: data, models, data-model comparison, and forecasting. The network has money (Â£75,000 per group) available for each group to organise meetings, and carry out feasibility studies.


I've always found the phrase **data-model comparison** a bit vague, and never really known what it means.
I asked various statisticians at the conference, and none of them were any the wiser, yet whenever I ask climate scientists I'm told it's meaning is obvious. I'm used to scientific communities using different terminologies: parameter estimation is calibration or tuning; different models may refer to the same model run with different parameter settings; etc. So my initial guess was that data-model comparison might have a different label in statistics. It could be parameter estimation, or model selection, or perhaps it is quantifying model discrepancy/error. Yet having dug a little deeper, it appears to be none of these things.

I'm well used to being confused, but this started to matter
